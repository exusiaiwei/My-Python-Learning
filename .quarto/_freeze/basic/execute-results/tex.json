They are used to represent non-printing characters, special characters, or characters with special meanings.\n\nEscape sequences start with a backslash (`\\`) and are followed by one or more characters to represent a specific character or operation. By using escape sequences, we can insert these special characters into strings, rather than interpreting them as ordinary characters.\n\nDefinition and Characteristics of Escape Sequences:\n\n- Escape sequences start with a backslash (`\\`).\n- Escape sequences are formed by one or more characters.\n- Escape sequences are used to represent non-printing characters, special characters, or characters with special meanings.\n- Escape sequences can be used in strings, character constants, regular expressions, and other contexts.\n\nHere are some common escape sequences and what they represent:\n\n- `\\n`: newline\n- `\\t`: tab\n- `\\r`: carriage return\n- `\\'`: single quote\n- `\\\"`: double quote\n- `\\\\`: backslash\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Using escape sequences to represent special characters in strings:\nprint(\"Hello\\tWorld\")  # Output: Hello    World\nprint(\"I\\'m a programmer\")  # Output: I'm a programmer\nprint(\"She said, \\\"Hello!\\\"\")  # Output: She said, \"Hello!\"\nprint(\"\\\"I love you.\\\" \\n \\\"Me too.\\\"\")\n\n# Using escape sequences to match special characters in regular expressions:\nimport re\npattern = r\"\\d+\"  # Matches one or more digits\nresult = re.findall(pattern, \"12345\")\nprint(result)  # Output: ['12345']\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello\tWorld\nI'm a programmer\nShe said, \"Hello!\"\n\"I love you.\" \n \"Me too.\"\n['12345']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Variables\n\nA variable is a concept in Python that is used to store and manipulate data. It can store various types of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- You can store data in a variable via an assignment operation.\n- You can use the variable name to access the data stored in the variable.\n- The value of a variable can be modified at any time.\n- Variables can be used and passed at different locations in a program.\n- The scope of a variable can be limited within a specific block of code.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ni = 5\nprint(i)\n\ne = ( i + 1 ) * 2\n\nprint(e)\n\ns = '''This is a multi-line string.\nThis is the second line.'''\n\nprint(s)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n5\n12\nThis is a multi-line string.\nThis is the second line.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Execution Logic\n\n### Logical Lines and Physical Lines\n\nA logical line refers to a line in the code that represents a statement or command, while a physical line refers to the text that actually occupies a line in the code file.\n\nA logical line can span multiple physical lines by connecting multiple physical lines into one logical line using line connectors (`\\`). A physical line is the actual number of lines in the code file, with each physical line ending with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nFeatures of Logical Lines:\n\n- A logical line can contain one or more statements or commands.\n- Logical lines can span multiple physical lines.\n- A logical line ends with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nFeatures of Physical Lines:\n\n- Physical lines are the actual number of lines in the code file.\n- Each physical line ends with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nPython encourages each physical line to correspond to one logical line, that is, one statement per line, to ensure code readability.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Example of a logical line spanning multiple physical lines\nx = 1 + \\\n    2 + \\\n    3\n\nprint(x)\n\n# Example of logical lines being the same as physical lines\ny = 5\nprint(y)\n\ny = 5;\nprint(y);\n\ny = 5; print(y);\n\ny = 5; print(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n6\n5\n5\n5\n5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Indentation\n\nIndentation is a syntax rule in Python used to represent the hierarchical structure of the code blocks. In Python, the indentation is mandatory and it determines the execution order and logical relations of the code. The level of indentation of the logical lines determines the grouping of the statements. Statements in the same group form a block of code.\n\nBasic Concepts:\n\n- Indentation is achieved through the use of spaces or tabs.\n- The amount and style of indentation must remain consistent, typically four spaces are recommended for indentation.\n- The hierarchal structure of the indentation determines the nesting relation of the code blocks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Indentation is used to define code blocks for functions, loops, conditional statements, and more.\n- Indentation can enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.\n- Indentation errors can lead to syntax errors or logical errors.\n\nCode Example:\nHere is one example where indentation forms blocks of code:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef greet(name):\n    if name == \"Alice\":\n        print(\"Hello, Alice!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Hello, stranger!\")\n\ngreet(\"Bob\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello, stranger!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
