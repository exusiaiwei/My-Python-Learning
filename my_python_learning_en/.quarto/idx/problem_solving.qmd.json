{"title":"Problem Solving","markdown":{"headingText":"Problem Solving","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe ultimate goal of programming is to utilize programs to solve specific problems.\n\n## Software Development Process\nA basic software development process is:\n\n1. Analysis (What): Define the problem we want to solve\n2. Design (How): Determine methods to achieve goals\n3. Implementation (Do It): Start from a simple version first, implement core functionalities\n4. Testing and Debugging (Test): Verify program runs as expected, identify and fix errors\n5. Operation or Deployment: Observe program behavior through actual usage\n6. Maintenance: Optimize and upgrade program based on feedback from usage stage\n\n::: {.callout}\nSoftware is grown, not built. -- Bill de hÓra\n\n软件是成长的,而不是建造的。-- Bill de hÓra\n:::\n\n## Problem Example: Backup Program\n\nThe problem presented in \"A Byte of Python\" is:\n\n::: {.callout}\nI want a program which creates a backup of all my important files.\n\n我想要一个能够备份我所有重要文件的程序。\n:::\n\nThe design idea is:\n\n- Backup files and directories are specified in a list.\n- Backups must be stored in a main backup directory.\n- Files are backed up into a zip file.\n- Zip file name is current date and time.\n- Uses standard Linux/Unix zip command which is default available in any standard GNU/Linux or Unix distribution. Note you can use any archiving command if you have a CLI.\n\n## Knowledge Points\n\nSome key knowledge points from the sample code in this A Byte of Python chapter:\n\n### Python String Formatting\n#### The `.format()` Method\nThe `.format()` method is a way of formatting strings where we can insert values into string template placeholders. For example:\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"\nprint(\"Hello, {}\".format(name)) # Prints: Hello, Alice\n```\nIn this code, `{}` is a placeholder where variable `name` can be passed into `.format()` method and automatically replaces the placeholder.\n\nWe can also add numbers inside `{}` to specify positions of `.format()` method arguments:\n\n```python\nfirstname = \"Alice\"\nlastname = \"Bob\"\nprint(\"Hello, {0} {1}\".format(firstname, lastname)) # Prints: Hello, Alice Bob\n```\nHere `{0}` and `{1}` correspond to first and second arguments of `.format()` method respectively.\n\n### f-strings (Formatted String Literals)\nIn Python 3.6 and later, we usually use f-strings for string formatting, which makes formatting more concise and efficient. F-strings work by prefixing `f` or `F` before the string, then write variables or expressions to insert inside `{}`, Python automatically replaces them with values. For example:\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}\") # Prints: Hello, Alice\n```\nWe can write simple Python expressions inside `{}`, Python executes them and replaces `{}` with the result:\n\n```python\na = 5\nb = 10\nprint(f\"Five plus ten is {a + b}, not {2 * (a + b)}.\") # Prints: Five plus ten is 15, not 30.\n```\n### Using OS Path Separators in Python\nFile path representations differ across operating systems. On Windows systems we use backslash `\\` for paths like `C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents`. On UNIX systems (Linux, MacOS) forward slash `/` is used instead, e.g. `/home/admin/Documents`.\n\nHowever in Python strings, backslash `\\` is a special character used as the escape character for introducing special character sequences. E.g. `\\n` for newline, `\\t` for tab. For example:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello\\nWorld\") # Prints:\n# Hello\n# World\n```\n\nSo if we want to use Windows paths like `C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents` in Python strings, we need to escape with double backslashes `\\\\` like `C:\\\\Users\\\\Admin\\\\Documents`. Code sample:\n\n```python\npath = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Admin\\\\Documents\"\nprint(path) # Prints: C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\n```\n\nAdditionally, we can use Python raw strings that treat backslashes `\\` literally instead of escape characters. Just prefix string with `r`:\n\n```python\npath = r\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\"\nprint(path) # Prints: C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\n```\nHowever it's not recommended to directly use single backslashes `\\` for Windows paths in strings, as unwanted escape sequences can easily be introduced, e.g. `\\U` starts a Unicode escape sequence, if this happens to appear in a path, Python tries to interpret it as special character sequence leading to errors. So best avoid paths like `C:\\Users`.\n\nNote: In most cases, we recommend using the `os.path` module to handle paths for cross-platform portability.\n\n## Other Problems\n\nOther beginner-friendly problems with similar difficulty:\n\n- A program that organizes my documents in multiple folders into types (.doc, .pdf etc) stored neatly into separate folders\n- A program that resizes all my images to specified sizes\n- A program that counts word frequency for each word in an English article\n- A program that finds identical files across two folders and lists them
